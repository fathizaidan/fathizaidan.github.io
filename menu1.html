		They have released two studio albums to date, Manifest Decimation (2013) and Nightmare Logic (2017), plus a compilation including their early tracks and a live album.

		Power Trip was one of the most successful thrash metal bands of the 2010s, with Nightmare Logic entering the Billboard charts, and receiving a number of accolades by publications.

		Their sound has been described by critics as thrash metal and hardcore punk, as well as simply crossover thrash. Gale cited the importance of 
		guitar riffs and pop songs: "Some of Blake [Ibanez]'s favorite bands are Killing Joke, Stone Roses, Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Wipers".
		Gale said that he worked hard to do concise lyrics: "each word relates to the sentence, and how the sentence relates to the verse.
		Making sure everything's connected and there's not a syllable wasted." "I try to write something that's catchy that people can sing along to mindlessly".
		"[I write about] the frustrations with what I see. People's motivations". AllMusic wrote that their music reached fans of both "hardcore punk and extreme music".
